# Almahdia Fashion App

Live demo: https://almahdia-fashion-app.vercel.app

A clean, responsive fashion store frontend built with Next.js (React) and modern CSS. This project showcases product listings, product details, a client-side shopping cart (saved to `localStorage`), and polished UI sections (hero, features, about, contact). Deployed on Vercel.
